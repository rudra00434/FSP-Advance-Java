## Introduction : 
Web development is the concept that encompasses all the activities involved with websites and web applications.
web development is the umbrella term for conceptualizing creating deploying and operating web applications for the web.
java offers higher cross-functionality and portability as programs written in one platform an run across desktops , mobiles ,embedded systems.
java is free , simple ,object oriented , distributed , supports multithreading and offers multimedia and network support 
being highly popular at enterprise . embedded and network level , java has a large active user community and support .
Java has powerful development tools like eclipse capability and offer integrated development environment (IDE)

## Java2-EE : 
j2EE is a platform -independent , java centric environment developing , building and deploying web based enterprise applications online .
The j2EE platform consists of a set services , Apis , and protocols that provide the functionality for developing multimedia ,web based 
applications .
Enterprise programming : It is used for creating and developing enterprise applications 
A software application composition can be broken down into 3 fundamental logical layers
Presentation layer : It is the user interface or frontend which is responsible for displaying stuff to the user and collecting data from the user 
Business layer : In this layer the application works and handles the important processing 
Data Access Layer : This part of the software is responsible and writing the data from the source that stores information 

## Client - Server Architecture :
Client : Client is a computer which accepts data from the user and sends  request to the server for processing those data 
server : A server is also a computer which accepts the data coming from the client processes it and send necessary responses back to the client from which the request came 
Types of Client - server architecture : 
based on the nature of request and response the client server can be classified into following :
1) Single tier architecture 
2) two tier architecture 
3) three tier architeture 
4) N- tier 
## Single tier :
In single tier architecture the client machines are called dump terminals because they doesn't have any processing power of their own .
these type of the architeture have economic feasibility 
if somehow the server crashes the entire architecture also crashes and all the data stored in the server also lost

## Two tier architecture 
as some of the server loads are shared by the client so this architecture bit faster as compared to single tier architecture .
if somehow the server fails crashes the vital data lost 
costlier than single tier

# Three-tier architecture :
in three tier architecture the server splitted into two - 1) web server , 2) Database server 
1) the webserver is responsible for handleing the request coming from the client .
2) Database responsible for storing the data
if anyone of these two server fails then also the entire architecture crashes
it more costlier that previous two architecture

 ## N-tier architecture :
